# Registry Concept in windows
- Registry is a database in harddrive that stores important settings for both windows and all available programs(apps) in our system.
- In early days, the windows settings and all app settings stored in small text file called **ionize**.
- Microsoft developed **Registry** , It helps to store multiple settings for all users in hierarchical structure.
- We can open Registry editor by using **regedit.exe** in run window.
- Registry stored in Key-Value pair.
- To view or modify the Registry, the Registry Editor program is used.
- Some keys may be empty, though they still contain a Default value. Thatâ€™s because **all keys must contain a value or a subkey**.
